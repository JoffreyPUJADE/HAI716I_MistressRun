# Compilation

This project uses Maven. The `pom.xml` file automates compilation and installation of dependencies. A compilation directive creates a `JAR` archive containing the compiled code and dependencies (file `...-jar-with-dependencies.jar` in the generated `target/` directory). This archive can be executed in standalone mode.

The compilation command is : `mvn package`.

# Execution

To run the project, under Windows, simply double-click on the `...-jar-with-dependencies.jar` archive in the `target/` directory generated by compilation.

Under Linux, the command `java -jar [NOM_ARCHIVE]-jar-with-dependencies.jar` is used to execute it.

A `launch.sh` file contains the project execution command, to make the execution command less verbose if required.
